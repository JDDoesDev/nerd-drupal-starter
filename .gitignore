# This file contains .gitignore rules that are often used with Drupal projects.
# Because .gitignore is specific to your site and its deployment processes, you
# may need to uncomment, add, or remove rules.

# To ignore all paths that composer manages when using this project template,
# remove all double-hashed () lines.

# Ignore custom modules managed by Composer.
#
# When a development team creates one or more custom modules that
# are intended for use on more than one site, the typical strategy
# is to register them in Packagist and give them the type
# `drupal-custom-module` instead of `drupal-module`. This will cause
# Composer to install them to the directory `modules/custom`.
#
# An alternate strategy for custom modules is to commit them
# directly to the repository of the site where they are used. This
# is commonly done with modules that are specific to just one site.
#
# Sites that have both Composer-managed custom modules and custom
# modules that are committed directly to the repository may ignore
# the `modules/custom` directory with the first rule shown below,
# and then allow the locations to be committed on a case-by-case
# basis by re-adding paths using `!` rules. A path that begins with
# a `!` will allow a previously-ignored path to be added to the
# repository. Note, however, that a path cannot be re-added if any
# of its parent directories are excluded. This is why we use the
# rule `/modules/custom/*` instead of `/modules/custom`.
#
# Sites that do not have any Composer-managed custom modules may
# delete all of the `modules/custom` lines below.

# Ignore directories generated by Composer. Adding both docroot and web
# folders to ensure that it works for multiple scenarios.

# See the "installer-paths" section in the top-level composer.json

# Generally you should only ignore the root vendor directory. It's important
# that core/assets/vendor and any other vendor directories within contrib or
# custom module, theme, etc., are not ignored unless you purposely do so.
/vendor/

# Ignore scaffold files
#
# Note that the scaffold plugin may be used to automatically manage
# a site's .gitignore files. If the `vendor` directory is ignored,
# then one or more .gitignore files will be written to also ignore
# any file placed by scaffolding. To avoid the creation of
# additional .gitignore files, add all of the scaffold file
# locations to the top-level .gitignore file, as shown below.
